You grant OpinionMatrix a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, reproduce, modify (e.g., for formatting), create derivative works (e.g., aggregated or anonymized analytics), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute your User Content for the purpose of operating, improving, and providing the Service, including moderation, safety, and research.</p>
      <p>You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant this license and that your User Content complies with applicable law and these Terms. We may remove content or restrict accounts at our discretion to enforce these Terms or protect users.</p>

        <li>Interfering with the Service, including scraping, bulk harvesting, or running automated bots not permitted by us.</li>
        <li>Uploading malware or content that may harm systems or data.</li>
        <li>Collecting or processing personal data through the Service in violation of law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. AI/ML‑Assisted Features</h2>
      <p>The Service may provide automated summaries, classifications, or insights using machine‑learning models. Outputs can be inaccurate or incomplete and are provided for informational purposes only; they do not constitute advice. Evaluate outputs independently before relying on them.</p>

      <h2>7. Moderation</h2>
      <p>We may, but are not obligated to, monitor activity or content on the Service. We may remove content, suspend functionality, or terminate accounts to enforce these Terms or to protect users and third parties.</p>

      <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>We and our licensors own the Service and all intellectual property therein (including software, models, design, and trademarks). Except for the limited rights expressly granted, no rights are transferred to you. Use of our names, logos, or branding requires prior written permission.</p>

      <h2>9. Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>The Service may integrate third‑party services (for example, authentication, storage, hosting, analytics). Your use of third‑party services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third‑party services.</p>

      <h2>10. Feedback</h2>
      <p>If you submit feedback, ideas, or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, royalty‑free license to use them without restriction or compensation.</p>

      <h2>11. App Stores</h2>

      <h2>12. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non‑infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free, or that content will be accurate or reliable.</p>

      <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or related to the Service is limited to the greater of (a) the amount you paid to us for the Service in the 12 months preceding the claim or (b) USD $50.</p>

      <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless OpinionMatrix and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to your use of the Service, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.</p>

      <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access immediately for any reason, including actual or suspected violations of these Terms. Upon termination, the licenses granted to you terminate.

      <h2>16. Changes</h2>
      <p>We may modify the Service and these Terms. We will provide notice of material changes by updating the Effective date above or by other reasonable means. Your continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>

      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <em>[Your Jurisdiction]</em>, without regard to its conflict‑of‑laws principles. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in <em>[Your Venue]</em>, unless arbitration is mutually agreed or required by law.</p>
